        <p>
            Let's dive into <strong>the art of homemade pizza dough</strong>!<br>
            It may seem like a <em>lot of work</em>, but the results promise a delicious meal and the <strong>satisfaction</strong> of mastering a kitchen staple.<br>
            With just a handful of ingredients and a bit of patience for rising and resting, you'll soon be on your way to creating a pizza crust that's crispy on the outside and delightfully chewy on the inside.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups warm water(600 mL)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup semolina flour(30 g)</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaf</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water.</li>
            <li>Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
            <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. (The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.)</li>
            <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.</li>
            <li>Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 230-260˚C.</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</li>
            <li>Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</li>
            <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. (Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce,small pieces of mozzarella and basil leafs.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
