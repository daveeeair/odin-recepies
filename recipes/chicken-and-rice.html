        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast (4 small or 2 large cut in half lengthwise for thinner pieces)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 can (10.5 ounces) Campbell’s® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup or 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup or Unsalted Cream of Chicken Soup</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked instant white rice (for creamier rice, decrease to 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh or frozen broccoli florets (about 6 ounces)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides (to prevent sticking- make sure the skillet and oil are hot before adding the chicken).</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Stir the soup, water and paprika in the skillet and heat to a boil. Stir in the rice and broccoli.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low. Return the chicken to the skillet and sprinkle the chicken with additional paprika.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is done and the rice is tender.</li>
            <li>Season to taste before serving.</li>
        </ol>
